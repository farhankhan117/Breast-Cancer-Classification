# Logistic Regression - Breast Cancer Classification

## Objective  
Build a logistic regression model to classify tumors as malignant or benign based on features extracted from breast mass digitized images.

## Tools & Libraries  
- Python  
- Pandas  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  

## Summary of Steps  
- Loaded the breast cancer dataset and explored structure and statistics  
- Removed non-informative column (`Unnamed: 32`) with all missing values  
- Converted diagnosis labels: Malignant (M) to 1, Benign (B) to 0  
- Split dataset into training (80%) and testing (20%) subsets  
- Standardized features using StandardScaler for optimal model performance  
- Built and trained a logistic regression model on the training set  
- Predicted on test data and evaluated using confusion matrix, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC  
- Plotted ROC curve to visualize classifier performance  
- Adjusted classification threshold to observe changes in precision and recall  

## Conclusion  
The logistic regression classifier achieved high precision and ROC-AUC, showing strong performance in distinguishing malignant from benign tumors. Threshold tuning further improved precision without compromising recall, highlighting the model’s flexibility in medical classification tasks.
